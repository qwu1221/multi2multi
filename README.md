# A multivariate to multivariate approach for voxel-wise genome-wide association analysis

"bipar_greedy.m" is from Algorithm 1 to maximize the objective function (4)

"greedy_lik.m" is to select the tunning parameter via likelihood function using Algorithm A1

"Refine_spatial.m" corresponds to Algorithm A2 that extract IGDB with spatial constraint
